# BC0401
School Python project on helping businesses that are affected by the Covid-19 restrictions and situation on their decision making process.
## About 
My team and I came out with a simple idea that shows the back-end of how this system works. We will be targeting restaurant businesses and focus more on the crowd control aspect - Queue system and Reservation System.
### Lunch - Queue System
For Lunch, we thought of helping out the restaurant in terms of crowd control whcih involves data analysis side and also operational side. We will provide people with more accurate estimated waiting time by using past data and also contninuosly taking in new data of the waiting time. We help employees to make decision on what advices to give to customers and also on what to do depending on the crowd. 

### Dinner - Reservation System
We created a system such that any employees are able to utilise it to help book reservations for customers for up to 7 days from the day itself. The details of the customers would be checked when employees input into the sytem and saved into a csv file for the respective date and dining slot. This helps employees in the decision making on whether to take in the customers when the slots for a certain day is filled and what advicethe ycan give to their customers if their inital wanted slot is not available. 

### Part 2 - Trends in Data 
Using python to generate graphs and charts of the trends in the data on Covid-19 and Tourism Industry. Pandas was used.
